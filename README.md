Step8 - 8-render-nested-routes-as-nested-components

## Step8.

1. Entire library of React Router v4/v5 has been built as React components.
2. As each route is a react component, we can have nest those react routes as components where they appear.
3. Lets implement following routes and nested routes:

```
   /step8
   /step8/home
   /step8/menu
   /step8/menu/food
   /step8/menu/drinks
   /step8/menu/sides
```
